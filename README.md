# The Tea-Ware License (Version 2.0)

Welcome to the Tea-Ware license repository!

It is a permissive license, the only requirement being including the notice in derivatives, and is intended for people that like tea (and hot chocolate).

Based on the MIT license, it is designed to be legally valid, but it adds a friendly touch with the mention of tea.
